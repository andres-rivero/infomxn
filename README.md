# infomxn

This is the [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) version of a web app that tracks the daily buy/sell rate of the Mexican peso at various banks. The original is built using [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) (not public).

The purpose of this project is to get a hang of Meteor, since I find that using JavaScript helpers to display data to be quite handy and efficient. My goal is to eventually learn how to automate and store this data in a MongoDB database.
