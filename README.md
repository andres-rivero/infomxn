This is the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) version of a web app that tracks the daily buy/sell rate of the Mexican peso at various banks. The original is built using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) (not public).

The purpose of this project is to get a hang of Meteor and JavaScript/Node, since I find that using JSON files and JS helpers to display data to be quite efficient for a project like this. My goal is to eventually learn how to automate and store this data in a MongoDB database.
